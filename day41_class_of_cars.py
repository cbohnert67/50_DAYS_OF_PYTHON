"""Create three classes of three car brands â€“ Ford, BMW, and
Tesla. The attributes of the car's objects will be, model,
color, year, transmission, and whether the car is
electric or not (Boolean value.) Consider using inheritance
in your answer.
You will create one object for each car brand:
bmw1 : model: x6, Color: silver, Year: 2018, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False
tesla1: model: S, Color: beige, Year: 2017, Transmission: Auto, Electric: True
ford1 : model: focus, Color: white, Year: 2020, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False
You will create a class method, called print_cars that will be
able to print out objects of the class. For example, if you call the
method on the ford1 object of the Ford class, your function
should be able to print out car info in this exact format:
car_model = focus
Color = White
Year = 2020
Transmission = Auto
Electric = False"""
