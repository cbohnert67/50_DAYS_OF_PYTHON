# 50 Days of Python

83 challenges tackled in 4 hours with Github Copilot.

If I were alone on the task, ie. without using Github Copilot, I would say I would have needed around half an hour per challenge. 

A quick back of the envelop calculation is simple to do:

0.5 hours per challenge X 83 challenges is about 40 hours.

So that the increase in time is nearly 1000%.

What a considerable gain !Thank you LLMs !
