# 50 Days of Python in 4 hours

83 Python challenges solved in 4 hours instead of 40 hours!? 😆

That's a time saving of almost 1000%!

Yes, you read that right. 1000% time saving!

It's a little experiment to do at home. 😅

The recipe?

Take a book like '50 days of Python. A challenge a day'. Get comfortable in front of your computer, warm up the TAB key and let your Github Copilot assistant do the work! 😅

Because yes! Github Copilot coded for me the 83 solution functions of the 83 challenges in the book.

A quick calculation on the back of an envelope shows a time saving of 1000%.

I find this really impressive because, out of the 83 challenges, I only intervened on 3 of them.

To qualify my remarks, however, it must be acknowledged that these 83 challenges are rather simple to develop.

But no bugs. The Python code generated by Copilot uses the standard library and in particular constructions such as comprehension structures.

I therefore consider it to be well-written code for small features developed so quickly.

We can therefore conclude that this code assistant is useful from this point of view, right?

For me, it allows me to focus more on the design, testing and optimization of the code. 🌱 👍

What a considerable gain! Thank you LLMs!

What do you think? Do you use it too?
