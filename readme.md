# 50 Days of Python

83 challenges tackled in 4 hours with Github Copilot.

If I were alone on the task, ie. without using Github Copilot, I would say I would have needed around half an hour per challenge. 

A quick back of the envelop calculation is simple to do:

$\frac{1}{2} \text{ hours par challenge } \times 83 challenges \approx 40 \text{ hours }

So that the increase in time is nearly $1000 %$ !

What a considerable gain !

Thank you LLM !
